My cell calculator is free for everyone to use. It is designed so that you can upload an image (jpg, jpeg, png, etc.), then use the mouse to outline all the individual cells, and finally calculate the content of each cell, or the total content of all cells, as well as the average value.

To convert pixel size into nanometers, you can simply enter the width of the image in nanometers, and the program will automatically scale it to the cells.

The result can then be copied directly in Excel format using a hotkey, or you can immediately export an Excel table. Other hotkeys are explained within the program.

I would have liked to upload the .exe file as well, but the file size is too large. You can create your own .exe file on Windows using the command:
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed CellAreaCalculator.py

Of course, you need to navigate to the folder first and install PyInstaller and any required packages.
